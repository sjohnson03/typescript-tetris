# Tetris in TypeScript
Originally created as part of an assignment for a functional programming course. This is a simple recreation of the popular game Tetris built TypeScript with RxJS.

A large focus on the code was immutability. This helped to write safer code and eliminate unpredictable behavior. This heavy emphasis on immutability was supported with the extensive use of RxJS functions.


## Usage

Setup (requires node.js):
```
> npm install
```

Serve up the App (and ctrl-click the URL that appears in the console)
```
> npm run dev
```

## Implementing features
 - Fill this out sometime


## TODO
 - Improve visual design (styling, scary)
